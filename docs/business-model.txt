ING has 8 million private customers NL

NL has 13.6 million citizens
NL has 7.2 million cars

=> ~ 1 in 2 NL citizens owns a car

In 2017 there were 418.461 cars sold in NL

=> ~ 1 in 17 cars was replaced in 2017



So 8 million customers
own 4 million cars
and replace 235.294 cars each year


If we can help 1% of our customers who buy a new car
Then we reach 2.300 customers

( 8.000.000 / 2 / 17 x 1% )


The average price for a new car in 2016 was 30.778 euro

=> the total spending on cars we cover amounts to 70 million euro

( 2300 x 30.778 )
